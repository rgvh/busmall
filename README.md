// DONE Create BusMall object and pushes it to the allItems array
// DONE Track image appearances and clicks
// DONE Display results in a chart
// DONE Persist results in local storage

// TODO Clear last group of three product images from the screen when the survey is completed
// TODO Display results in a list with rows like "3 votes for the Banana Slicer"
